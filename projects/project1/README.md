CART 253 - With Professor Barr
by Azmat Ishaq

This is a Javascript game made for the CART253 Class at Concordia University.

This is a game where you can play as Gabe Newell. The objective is to avoid the Half Life 3 projectiles from convincing you to make Half Life 3.

Just dodge, what comes at you. Make sure your CONVINCE BAR doesn't fill to the max!

If it does, Gabe will have to make Half Life 3 and you will lose the game.

Use the arrow keys to move your character.
