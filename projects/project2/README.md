This is poject made by Azmat Ishaq 2 for CART253 with Pippin Barr and Concordia University


**Artist Statement**

As part of my computer arts practice I made this maze game for the CART253 class. The game began with a modest maze structure based on Pippin Barr's maze example found here: https://editor.p5js.org/pippinbarr/sketches/Xq3qsbQWA


Significant contributions to the code were made Sabine Rosenberg, Pipping Barr, and Madeline Zaytsoff.

All of the visual art work is original. The item images, door, and mouse sprite were made on a website called https://www.pixilart.com/.

The sound for the pickups uses the p5 oscillator. However, the pickup for the cheese is a sound that was gathered from https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/video-game/ and it was entitled "Retro Game Notification".

The sound of the mouse squeaking when it is hit by radiation was made by myself by stepping on my floorboards and recording the resulting sound.

The sound for the low health alert was edited acoustic guitar audio.

I used the website https://audiomass.co/ to edit the sounds.
