Project 2 - Morry's Maze

This is a project made by Azmat Ishaq for CART253 with Pippin Barr and Concordia University


**Artist Statement**

As part of my computation arts practice I made this maze game for the CART253 class. The game began with a modest maze structure based on Pippin Barr's maze example found here: https://editor.p5js.org/pippinbarr/sketches/Xq3qsbQWA

There were several significant accomplishments. Though it was helpful having a starting maze structure, the structure itself had to be built on and rearranged in order to use it in a more versatile fashion.

I think it is also worth noting that there could be significantly more levels. I decided to keep the levels at 5 in order to allow for a reasonable assessment of the game and code.

Making the maze trail effect by studying my existing code and using the lessons I learned was a big achievement for me. It is evidence that my skill as a computation artist is growing.

Significant contributions to the code were made Sabine Rosenberg, Pipping Barr, and Madeline Zaytsoff.

All of the visual art work is original. The item images, door, and mouse sprite were made on a website called https://www.pixilart.com/.

The sound for the pickups uses the p5 oscillator.

The sound for the low health alert is a recording of my own acoustic guitar audio that I digitally altered and sped up.

The sound of the mouse squeaking when it takes damage was made by myself by stepping on my floorboards and recording the resulting sound.

*The following sounds were used from a sound library at https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/video-game/ :*

The pickup sound for the cheese, it was entitled "Retro Game Notification".

The end losing sound it was entitled "Arcade Space Shoot Dead Notification"

The level music it was entitled "Classic Arcade Video Game"

The ending music it was entitled "Game Level Music 689"




I used the website https://audiomass.co/ to edit some of my sounds.
