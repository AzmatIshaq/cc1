****Project 2 - Morry's Maze****

This is a project made by Azmat Ishaq for CART253 with Pippin Barr and Concordia University.

Thank you to Sabine Rosenberg, Pipping Barr, and Madeline Zaytsoff for their contributions to the project.


**Artist Statement**

As part of my computation arts practice I made this maze game for the CART253 class. The game began with a modest maze structure based on Pippin Barr's maze example found here: https://editor.p5js.org/pippinbarr/sketches/Xq3qsbQWA

The idea was to create a retro style arcade game with levels. The user should experience something similar to playing a Pacman game. I believed I accomplished this by utilizing a grid style pattern in order to track the player movements and by labelling and tracking the pickups and items. I also used the keypressed function to do a lot of triggering.

There were several significant personal accomplishments throughout the process.

Making the maze trail effect by studying my existing code and using the lessons I learned was a big achievement for me. It is evidence that my skill as a computation artist is growing.

Getting the health bar to blink when low and using my own recorded audio for the alert was also particularly satisfying. With that element I was really able to combine different disciplines and make them work together functionally.

Adding mute functionality was also a pretty big success.

Finally, just styling, tweaking, designing, writing, organizing, and combining the code together in a workable format successfully was a significant accomplishment for me.

For the levels I decided to start by showcasing each pickup, with a fog or cheese pickup, and then I combined them for the final levels. I am particularly glad that the setup of the code allows for multiple different combinations. In the future eventually incorporating a random level option is definitely possible because of that.

** Please note you only need 25 points to move between levels. If the exit door does not appear after that it will not show up again. This will occurs if you pickup your 25th item all the way at the right side of the map. The door will appear outside of the map and out of reach for the player. Unfortunately this was a late spotted bug that did not get patched. 

**Code Contributions**

Though it was helpful having a starting maze structure, the structure itself had to be built on and rearranged in order to use it in a more versatile fashion. To do this required help from the teaching team. Other sections involving for loops and arrays working together were at times beyond my current competency as a programmer and code contributions and help were given by the teaching staff.

Significant contributions to the code were made by Sabine Rosenberg, Pipping Barr, and Madeline Zaytsoff. See inline code comment for more details.

**Sources**

All of the visual art work is original. The item images, door, and mouse sprite were made on a website called https://www.pixilart.com/.

The sound for the pickups uses the p5 oscillator.

The sound for the low health alert is a recording of my own acoustic guitar audio that I digitally altered and sped up.

The sound of the mouse squeaking when it takes damage was made by myself by stepping on my floorboards and recording the resulting sound.

*The following sounds were used from a sound library at https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/video-game/ :*

The pickup sound for the cheese, it was entitled "Retro Game Notification".

The end losing sound, it was entitled "Arcade Space Shooter Dead Notification"

The level music, it was entitled "Classic Arcade Video Game"

The ending music, it was entitled "Game Level Music 689"

The intro music, it was entitled "Shopping List"




I used the website https://audiomass.co/ to edit some of my sounds.
